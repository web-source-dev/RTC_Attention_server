# Attention Detection System Improvements

## Overview

This document outlines the significant improvements made to the RTC Attention Detection System, focusing on enhanced head posture detection, looking away detection, drowsy detection, and sleeping detection.

## Key Improvements

### 1. Enhanced Head Posture Detection

#### Improved Landmark Detection
- **More Comprehensive Eye Landmarks**: Updated eye landmark indices to include 16 points per eye instead of the previous 12, providing better accuracy for eye openness detection.
- **Better Head Orientation Calculation**: Improved the calculation of yaw, pitch, and roll angles using more precise facial landmarks.

#### Enhanced Head Position Scoring
- **YAW Factor (Left-Right Rotation)**:
  - Looking straight: 1.0
  - Slight turn: 0.8
  - Moderate turn: 0.5
  - Significant turn: 0.2

- **PITCH Factor (Up-Down Rotation)**:
  - Looking straight: 1.0
  - Slight tilt: 0.7
  - Moderate tilt: 0.4
  - Significant tilt: 0.1

- **ROLL Factor (Head Tilt)**:
  - Straight head: 1.0
  - Slight tilt: 0.8
  - Moderate tilt: 0.5
  - Significant tilt: 0.2

### 2. Improved Looking Away Detection

#### Enhanced Thresholds
- **Primary Threshold**: `looking_score < 0.5`
- **Secondary Threshold**: `face_presence > 15 and looking_score < 0.7`
- **Weighted Combination**: 50% yaw, 30% pitch, 20% roll

#### Better Asymmetric Eye Detection
- Detects when eyes are asymmetric (indicating looking to the side)
- Penalizes eye openness score when asymmetry is detected
- Threshold: `eye_difference_ratio > 0.3`

### 3. Enhanced Drowsy Detection

#### Multi-Factor Analysis
The new drowsiness detection combines multiple factors:

1. **Eye Closure Factor (40% weight)**:
   - EAR < 0.15: 1.0 (fully drowsy)
   - EAR < 0.25: 0.7 (moderately drowsy)
   - EAR < 0.35: 0.3 (slightly drowsy)
   - EAR >= 0.35: 0.0 (alert)

2. **Head Dropping Factor (30% weight)**:
   - Pitch > 0.3: 1.0 (head dropped)
   - Pitch > 0.2: 0.6 (moderate drop)
   - Pitch > 0.1: 0.3 (slight drop)
   - Pitch <= 0.1: 0.0 (upright)

3. **Head Tilt Factor (20% weight)**:
   - Roll > 25째: 1.0 (significant tilt)
   - Roll > 15째: 0.5 (moderate tilt)
   - Roll <= 15째: 0.0 (straight)

4. **Eye Asymmetry Factor (10% weight)**:
   - Difference > 0.05: 1.0
   - Difference > 0.03: 0.5
   - Difference <= 0.03: 0.0

#### Improved Thresholds
- **Drowsy Detection**: `drowsiness_score > 60 or eye_openness < 10`
- **Enhanced Eye Openness Scoring**:
  - Very closed eyes (EAR < 0.15): `score = EAR * 40`
  - Partially closed (EAR < 0.25): `score = 6 + (EAR - 0.15) * 80`
  - Normal eyes (EAR < 0.35): `score = 14 + (EAR - 0.25) * 120`
  - Wide open eyes (EAR >= 0.35): `score = 26 + (EAR - 0.35) * 150`

### 4. New Sleeping Detection

#### Comprehensive Sleep Detection
The new sleeping detection system analyzes multiple factors:

1. **Eye Closure**: `eye_openness < 5` (very low eye openness)
2. **Head Dropping**: `pitch > 0.3` (head tilted forward)
3. **Head Tilt**: `abs(roll) > 30째` (significant head tilt)

#### Sleeping Score Calculation
- **Eyes Closed**: +0.4 (40% weight)
- **Head Dropping**: +0.3 (30% weight)
- **Head Tilted**: +0.2 (20% weight)
- **Sleeping Threshold**: `sleeping_score > 0.6`

### 5. Enhanced State Detection Logic

#### Improved State Classification
1. **ABSENT**: `face_presence < 8`
2. **SLEEPING**: `is_sleeping or sleeping_score > 0.7`
3. **DROWSY**: `drowsiness_score > 60 or eye_openness < 10`
4. **LOOKING_AWAY**: `looking_score < 0.5 or (face_presence > 15 and looking_score < 0.7)`
5. **ATTENTIVE**: `face_presence > 30 and eye_openness > 30 and looking_score > 0.8 and drowsiness_score < 30`
6. **ACTIVE**: `face_presence > 20 and eye_openness > 20 and looking_score > 0.6 and drowsiness_score < 50`

#### Attention Percentage Mapping
- **ATTENTIVE**: 95% (high attention)
- **ACTIVE**: 75% (moderate attention)
- **LOOKING_AWAY**: 40% (low attention)
- **DROWSY**: 25% (very low attention)
- **SLEEPING**: 5% (minimal attention)
- **ABSENT/DARKNESS**: 0% (no attention)

### 6. New Attention Categories

#### Enhanced Category System
- **ATTENTIVE**: Fully engaged users
- **DISTRACTED**: Users looking away or drowsy
- **SLEEPING**: Users who are sleeping
- **INACTIVE**: Absent users or dark environment
